* Gymnastics coach, P.S.P Borden. 

·	It is a small part of the P.S.P recreational activities on base. We use an old school gym filled with gymnastics equipment and run classes Saturdays, Tuesdays and Thursdays in 8-week sessions. My biggest accomplishments would be that I have gotten along with every co-worker to come and go and even make close friendships doing so. Also, it has given a chance to brush up on my communication skills with the children and their parents.

#### EDUCATION

Highschool graduate	27th June 2020 École secondaire catholique Nouvelle-Alliance in Barrie Ontario.


#### COMMUNICATION

I am bilingual in English and French; I have been speaking both languages since first grade. I consistently received 80s on oral presentation in both languages. I never shy from confrontation and speak my mind and the truth. My High Five training course taught me proper techniques to calm down situations and proper behavior while doing so.

#### LEADERSHIP

As a coach I am well known at my workplace for taking charge of the group when there is more than one coach assigned to the group. I lead the group to work well together and for the children to learn. Also, I can control and handle many situations or conflicts.

And when it came to working as a team, I never shy away from asking for help. I learned to work under pressure to get orders done quickly while withholding the standard of a well executedorder.
